Dear Mr.
I have had a very bad experience with your service. The issues started Friday night and have not been solved yet.
I want to complain strongly, this is not a proper way to treat your customers. Can you please let us know when are you going to fix it?
If your future services are as bad as they are now, I want a solution now.
